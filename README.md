## üëã About the repository

In work package 1, we assessed the computational reproducibility of eight discrete-event simulation papers with models in Python and R. The reproductions and findings are summarised at: <https://pythonhealthdatascience.github.io/stars_wp1_summary/>.

## üìç Locating tables and figures from the article

| Figure/Table | Method | Location |
| - | - | - |
| **Figure 1.** Five standards that scientific code should strive to achieve, and the benefits of doing so | Inkscape | `images/5rs.svg` |
| **Figure 2.** Time to complete items in scope for each reproduction, inspired by figure in Krafczyk et al. 2021 | Matplotlib | Created within `pages/reproduction.qmd`, saved as `images/article_times.png` |
| **Figure 3.** Recommendations to support reproduction, with stars to highlight five recommendations considered to have the greatest potential impact. | Inkscape | `images/reproduction_wheel.svg`|
| **Figure 4.** Recommendations to support troubleshooting and reuse | Inkscape | `images/troubleshooting_wheel.svg` |
| **Figure 5.** Of the eight healthcare DES studies evaluated, proportion that met each recommendation in the current STARS framework. | Plotly express | Created within `pages/repo_evaluation.qmd`, saved as `images/stars_criteria.png` |
| **Figure 6.** Of the eight healthcare DES studies evaluated, proportion that met each item in the current STRESS-DES criteria. | Plotly express | Created within `pages/paper_evaluation.qmd`, saved as `stress_criteria.png` |
| **Figure 7.** Of the eight healthcare DES studies evaluated, proportion that met each criteria in the general reporting checklist for DES | Plotly express | Created within `pages/paper_evaluation.qmd`, saved as `ispor_criteria.png` |
| **Table 2.** Evaluation of repositories against ACM badge criteria. | - | Created within `pages/repo_evaluation.qmd`, saved as `data/badges_table.csv` (and Table 2 is an extract from that table) |
| **Table 3.** Proportion of applicable criteria that were fully met, from evaluation of repository or article, alongside the proportion of items reproduced from each study. | - | Combination of two tables: (1) `data/applicable_stars.csv` created within `pages/repo_evaluation.qmd`, and (2) `data/applicable_report.csv` created within `pages/paper_evaluation.qmd` |
| **Table D1.** Evaluation of studies against badge criteria - grouped into three themes, as defined by NISO. | - | Created within `pages/repo_evaluation.qmd`, saved as `data/badges_table.csv` |

The remaining tables were created directly in the Latex article, rather than in this repository, as they are not describing results from reproduction:

* **Table 1.** Description of the included studies.
* **Table 4.** Simple checklists to assist reviewers in assessing the openness, longevity, and reproducibility of DES models during peer review.
* **Table B1.** Links for reproduction and evaluation.
* **Table B2.** Links to original study repositories.
