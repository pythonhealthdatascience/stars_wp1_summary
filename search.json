    "text": "4.1 Studies\nShoaib and Ramamohan (2021): This is a discrete-event simulation modelling primary health centres (PHCs) in India. There are four patient types: outpatients, inpatients, childbirth cases and antenatal care patients. Four model configurations are developed based on observed PHC practices or government-mandated operational guidelines. The paper explores different operational patterns for scenarios where very high utilisation was observed, to explore what might help reduce utilisation of these resources. (Article published as Shoaib and Ramamohan (2022), but we used the green open access pre-print). Link to reproduction.\nHuang et al. (2019): This is a discrete-event simulation model of an endovascular clot retrieval (ECR) service. ECR is a treatment for acute ischaemic stroke. The model includes the stroke pathway, as well as three other pathways that share resources with the stroke pathway: an elective non-stroke interventional neuroradiology pathway, an emergency interventional radiology pathway, and an elective interventional radiology pathway. The model is created using R Simmer. The paper explores waiting times and resource utilisation - particularly focussing on the biplane angiographic suite (angioINR). A few scenarios are tried to help examine why the wait times are so high for the angioINR. Link to reproduction.\nLim et al. (2020): This is a discrete-event simulation modelling the transmission of COVID-19 in laboratory. It examines the proportion of staff infected in scenarios varying the: number of shifts per day; number of staff per shift; overall staff pool; shift patterns; secondary attack rate of the virus; introduction of protective measures (social distancing and personal protective equipment). The model is created using Python. Link to reproduction.\nKim et al. (2021): This study adapts a previously developed discrete-event simulation model for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening of men in England. It aims to explore different approaches to resuming screening and surgical repair for AAA, as these survives were paused or substantially reduced during COVID-19 due to concerns about virus transmission. Link to reproduction.\nAnagnostou et al. (2022): This paper includes two models - we have focussed just on the dynamiC Hospital wARd Management (CHARM) model. CHARM is a discrete-event simulation modelling intensive care units (ICU) in the COVID-19 pandemic (as well as subsequent stays in a recovery bed). It includes three types of admission to the ICU (emergency, elective or COVID-19). COVID-19 patients are kept seperate, and if they run out of capacity due to a surge in COVID-19 admissions, additional capacity can be pooled from the elective and emergency capacity.

I later add seeds so my results could be reproduced, and found that the ease of setting seeds with salabim was a greater facilitator to the work. I only had to change one or two lines of code to then get consistent results between runs (unlike other simulation software like SimPy where you have to consider the use of seeds by different sampling functions). Moreover, by default, salabim would have set a seed (although overridden by original authors to enable them to run replications).\nHuang et al. (2019): It would have been beneficial to include seeds, as there was a fair amount of variability, so with seeds I could then I could be sure that my results do not differ from the original simply due to randomness.\nLim et al. (2020): The results obtained looked very similar to the original article, with minimal differences that I felt to be within the expected variation from the model stochasticity. However, if seeds had been present, we would have been able to say with certainty. I did not feel I needed to add seeds during the reproduction to get the same results.",
