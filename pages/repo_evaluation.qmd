title: "Evaluation of the repository"
echo: False
bibliography: ../references.bib
---

The code and related research artefacts in the original code repositories were evaluated against:

* The criteria of badges related to reproducibility from various organisations and journals.
* Recommendations from the STARS framework for the sharing of code and associated materials from discrete-event simulation models (@monks_towards_2024).

Between each journal badge, there was often alot of overlap in criteria. Hence, a list of unique criteria was produced. The repositories are evaluated against this criteria, and then depending on which criteria they met, against the badges themselves.

*Caveat: Please note that these criteria are based on available information about each badge online, and that we have likely differences in our procedure (e.g. allowed troubleshooting for execution and reproduction, not under tight time pressure to complete). Moreover, we focus only on reproduction of the discrete-event simulation, and not on other aspects of the article. We cannot guarantee that the badges below would have been awarded in practice by these journals.*

**Badges:**

The badges are grouped into three categories:

* "Open objects" badges: These badges relate to research artefacts being made openly available.
* "Object review" badges: These badges relate to the research artefacts being reviewed against criteria of the badge issuer.
* "Reproduced" badges: These badges relate to an independent party regenerating the reuslts of the article using the author objects.
