The table below outlines the factors that helped facilitate reproductions, or that would have been helpful (i.e. their absence was a barrier to the reproduction).

To present this concisely, each facilitator identified has been listed in a table, and I have evaluated for each study whether this was fully met (‚úÖ), partially met (üü°), not met (‚ùå) or not applicable (N/A).

@shoaib_simulation_2021: Became a time-consuming issue as it took a while to identify a dependency that was needed for the code to work (`greenlet`), and a while longer to realise I had installed another package when the package I needed was in base (`statistics`).

## Extra notes

**Environment: List required packages**

@shoaib_simulation_2021: Became a time-consuming issue as it took a while to identify a dependency that was needed for the code to work (greenlet), and a while longer to realise I had installed another package when the package I needed was in base (statistics)

**Environment: Versions**

* In one study (@shoaib_simulation_2021) I had to backdate the package versions as the didn't work with the latest
* @huang_optimizing_2019 -
* @lim_staff_2020 -
* @kim_modelling_2021 -
* @anagnostou_facs-charm_2022 -
* @johnson_cost_2021

**Output format: Easy to figure out how to use output table/s to create tables/figures**

* For @shoaib_simulation_2021, there were two alternative results spreadsheets with some duplicate metrics but sometimes differing results between them, which made it a bit confusing to work out what to use
