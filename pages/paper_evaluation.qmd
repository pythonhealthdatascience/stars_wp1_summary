This page shares the results from the evaluation of the journal articles against criteria from two discrete-event simulation study reporting guidelines:

* @monks_strengthening_2019 - STRESS-DES: Strengthening The Reporting of Empirical Simulation Studies (Discrete-Event Simulation) (Version 1.0).
* @zhang_reporting_2020 - The generic reporting checklist for healthcare-related discrete event simulation studies derived from the the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Society for Medical Decision Making (ISPOR-SDM) Modeling Good Research Practices Task Force reports.

Consider: **What criteria are people struggling to meet from the guidelines?**
